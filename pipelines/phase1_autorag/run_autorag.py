"""triggers a real run of documents-rag-optimization-pipeline, AutoRAG's
own kfp pipeline, which rhoai auto registers on every dspa pipeline
server (confirmed via official docs, not reverse engineered), rather
than reimplementing autorag's dashboard flow ourselves.

mirrors phase1_ingestion/compile_and_run.py's auth pattern (the caller's
own `oc whoami -t` token, no separate pipeline server credential) but
does not compile or upload anything: this pipeline already exists on
rag-phase1-dspa, this script only looks it up by name and runs it.

parameter names below come from actually reading this pipeline's own
live registered input definitions on this cluster (see
inspect_params.py), not from the compiled ir pulled from github earlier
in this project's investigation: that github copy (branch
rhoai-3.4-fixed) turned out to describe an older parameter shape
(llama_stack_secret_name, llama_stack_vector_io_provider_id,
embeddings_models) that this cluster's actually registered version has
since simplified to ogx_secret_name, vector_io_provider_id and
embedding_models. always trust the live registration over any external
copy.

parameters point at:
  - sanitized/ in the raw_bucket as the corpus autorag is allowed to
    index (the sanitized only boundary sanitize_documents itself
    enforces, see phase1_ingestion/pipeline.py)
  - the eval dataset phase1_ingestion_pipeline's generate_eval_dataset
    step wrote to autorag-eval/<batch_id>_test_data.json
  - the pgvector vector_io provider already live and healthy on
    rag-phase1-ogx (confirmed via a real /v1/providers call)
  - both foundation chat models plus the embedding model, all using the
    exact ids ogx's own /v1/models exposes (confirmed live), not the
    litellm double prefixed form sdg_hub needed: autorag talks to ogx
    directly by its own client, not through litellm's openai/ custom
    api_base routing, so no double prefix is needed here.
