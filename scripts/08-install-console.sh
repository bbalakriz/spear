# builds and deploys the console: the backend (manifests/spear-console)
# plus the frontend openshift console plugin

#
# NAMESPACE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md: the component itself is renamed, console
# not owner-console, since it is slated to also host the phase 2 chat tab,
# not just phase 1 ingestion controls. the source directories at the repo
# root (owner-console/owner-console-backend) keep their own names for
# now, that deeper rename is deliberately deferred, see the plan's own
# section 1, this script still builds from those paths
#
# MLFLOW_URL, DSPA_ROUTE and GUARDRAILS_ROUTE are never hardcoded anywhere
# in owner-console-backend/server.py: all three are openshift route
# hostnames, unique per cluster, so this script resolves them live and
# injects them into the backend deployment with `oc set env`, not the
# applied manifest itself, so a later `oc apply -f 01-backend.yaml` never
# wipes them out (they are absent from the manifest's own last applied
# configuration, so strategic merge leaves them alone, confirmed against
# how minio-dsp-creds style secrets are already handled in this project).
#
# run scripts/02-install-storage.sh, 04-install-pipelines.sh,
# 05-install-inference.sh and 07-install-guardrails.sh first, this script
# assumes every route it resolves below already exists.
