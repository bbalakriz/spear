# NAMESPACE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md section 8's own fold back decision:
# openproject (spear-worktracker) and the agents/gateways (spear-shield-agents)
# never actually need to install independently of each other in practice,
# one script, same as the old 08-install-spear-shield-agents.sh was before
# this migration split its own manifests across two namespaces.
#
# the realm, the self hosted openproject work tracker, spear-openproject-mcp,
# the gateway/auth policy chain in front of it, the guard proxy, and the a2a
# gateway plus cluster spiffeid the two sandboxed agents depend on. see
# PHASE2_PLAN.md sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. the sandboxed agents themselves
# (image builds, sandbox create, policy, provider) are now scripted too,
# see deploy_sandboxed_agents below, adapted from the reference project's
# own manifests/30-openshell/deploy-agents-job.yaml.tmpl (dbs-sow-assessment/
# rhoai-agentic-demo), which already proved the real openshell cli flags
# and ordering live: runtime_class_name is snake_case not the kubernetes
# field's own camelCase, providers_v2_enabled has to be turned on globally
# before provider profile import works, sandboxes have to be deleted
# before a provider attached to one can be deleted, and the coordinator
# always stays on runc, never kata, because its supervisor opens a csi
# spiffe workload api socket that a virtiofs mount inside a kata guest
# cannot proxy (kata-containers/kata-containers#13162, unmerged). the
# one real difference from that reference: this project runs these
# commands from the installer's own machine through a local port-forward
# to the shared openshell service, not as an in cluster job with its own
# built cli image, same convention every other oc exec/oc cp step in this
# script already uses
#
# nothing in here is cluster specific. every hostname (this cluster's own
# apps domain, the sso route, the guardrails route) is either constructed
# from `oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster` or resolved from an
# already live Route, same convention scripts/08-install-console.sh already
# uses, never typed in literally. every manifest under manifests/spear-shield-agents/
# and manifests/spear-worktracker/ that needs one of these carries a
# PLACEHOLDER token instead of a real value, substituted here before
# apply, same pattern the sibling rhoai-agentic-demo project's own
# deploy-agent-pack.sh uses.
#
# admin login, both personas' native accounts, the data-governance
# project, its three work packages, and both personas' api tokens are
# all seeded here too, see seed_openproject_demo_data(). an earlier
# version of this comment claimed personal api tokens need each persona
# to log in themselves, there is no admin api for it. found live during
# this build's schema drift recovery (PHASE2_PLAN.md section 4): that is
# true of openproject's own rest api, but not of rails console, which an
# admin already has full access to via oc exec, so this is scripted now
# too, the whole openproject side of this namespace is recoverable from
# a wiped database with a single rerun of this script.

one real thing worth checking after this, not assumed: manifests/spear-shield-agents/06-cluster-spiffeid.yaml
pins a literal agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash value for the coordinator sandbox,
confirmed live on an earlier cluster to be deterministic from the sandbox name alone,
but never independently reconfirmed on this one. compare it against the real pod:
  oc get pod -n ${AGENTS_NS} -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=openshell -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.labels.agents\.x-k8s\.io/sandbox-name-hash}{"\n"}'
and patch 06-cluster-spiffeid.yaml's own podSelector value if it differs.
